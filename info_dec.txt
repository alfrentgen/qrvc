1) In qrdectxt.c in function qr_code_data_list_extract_text() in section QR_MODE_BYTE we must do nothing, just put decoded bytes as is from in to out(but saving iconv() function logic for pointers shifts).
2) fstream should be used with buffer!!! https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26095160/why-are-stdfstreams-so-slow
3) optimize sync scheme so that it be more granular, particularly syncing only counter increment/decrement while putting/getting to/from queues
4) QUIRC doesn't recognize QR codes with blocksize less than 8x8
5) add decode lib switching if can't decode with quirc, try zbar.

checklist:
1) InputQueue - DONE
1) OutputQueue - 
2) Chunk - DONE
3) MTDecoder -
4) Worker -
5) Decode - 

26112017 TODO
1) Merge decoder and incoder into the one project.
2) Make encoder multithread.
3) Write OpenCL code for decoder.
4) Add options: enable/disable frame counter for encoder and decoder,
enable/disable hashsum for frame encoder/decoder, 
enable/disable hashsum check for skipping duplicated frames in decoder.
5) Find out why large QR codes are not supported by zbar and quirc.
