1) In qrdectxt.c in function qr_code_data_list_extract_text() in section QR_MODE_BYTE we must do nothing, just put decoded bytes as is from in to out(but saving iconv() function logic for pointers shifts).
2) fstream should be used with buffer!!! https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26095160/why-are-stdfstreams-so-slow


06122017 TODO
1) Make input and output queues asynch (make workers place jobs in the same slots)
(Syncing only chunk counter decrementation and index pointer change
while getting from an input queue. Then worker must put results into output 
queue using the same index, syncing only the incrementation of chunks counter).
2) Move hashsum calculations from put stage to decode stage.
3) Find out why large QR codes are not supported by zbar and quirc.
(QUIRC - DONE, ZBAR - still has an issue with 40 QR version)
4) Make encoder multithread.
5) Write OpenCL code for decoder.
6) Add options: enable/disable frame counter for encoder and decoder,
enable/disable hashsum for frame encoder/decoder, 
enable/disable hashsum check for skipping duplicated frames in decoder.
