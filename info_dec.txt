1) In qrdectxt.c in function qr_code_data_list_extract_text() in section QR_MODE_BYTE we must do nothing, just put decoded bytes as is from in to out(but saving iconv() function logic for pointers shifts).
2) fstream should be used with buffer!!! https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26095160/why-are-stdfstreams-so-slow

25122017 TODO:
1) Introduce frame hashsum(not decoded data hashsum!), to skip decoding of
duplicated frames if they occur in the input bunch of frames(--skip-dup option)
2) Move hashsum calculation to encode procedure instead of that in flush now.
3) Write OpenCL code for decoder.
4) Add options: enable/disable frame counter for encoder and decoder,
enable/disable hashsum for frame encoder/decoder,

DONE or not very urgent:
1) Make encoder multithread(in progress) DONE
2) Move hashsum calculations from put stage to decode stage.
NOT URGENT: single thread spends about 1 microsecond on hashsum calculation.
3) Make input and output queues asynch (make workers place jobs in the same slots)
(Syncing only chunk counter decrementation and index pointer change
while getting from an input queue. Then worker must put results into output
queue using the same index, syncing only the incrementation of chunks counter).
NOT URGENT: It seems that threads spend around 0-100 microseconds on waiting 
for chunk put/get operation VERY RARELY!
4) Find out why large QR codes are not supported by zbar and quirc.
(QUIRC - DONE, ZBAR - DONE). Zbar should be taken from github, Quick needs
QUIRC_MAX_REGION=65534 definition
5) Add config structure for enc/dec init and filling function in ArgsParser. DONE.
6) Add inverse colours QR code support. DONE.
7) add -r and -t options support in mtenc. DONE.
8) try to make decode libs quickier by using simplified image filtration.
   NOT URGENT. SEEMS THAT QUIRC ALREADY DO IT AS FAST AS POSSIBLE.
