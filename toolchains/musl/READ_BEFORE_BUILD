musl libc has DEFAULT_STACK_SIZE=80K, for preveting stack overflow crashes
we should use stack at least 512K(4096 flood_fill() invocations 96 bytes frame
), but it's better make stack size 1M.
Using musl-cross-make:
1) Place config.mak and specify target and other options in it.
2) do "make extract_all" for getting sources
3) open pthread_impl.h in musl source and redefine DEFAULT_STACK_SIZE=1048576
4) make
5) make install
