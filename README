For sake of integrity it is said, that this software uses following libraries:
1) libzbar 0.10
2) libqrencode 3.9.0
3) quirc 1.0
4) libwinpthread (windows build only)
5) musl libc (linux build only)

Zbar and qrencode library are under LGPL license. Thus they have to be built as
dynamic libraries, and they are. Until the whole source code of qrvc is open.

Texts of libraries' licenses are in the "licenses" directory:
LGPL.txt is for libzbar and libqrencode,
winpthread_license.txt is for libwinpthread,
musl_copyright.txt is for musl libc.

Windows versions of the software are built with mingw32-w64 cross compiler.
At least it works on wine, however 32 bit version is somehow not compatible with
64 bit Windows version. The software can run on Windows 7 or higher.

Linux versions of the software are build with musl based gcc cross compiler,
and should work on any linux platform. But these were only tested on Ubuntu 16.04.
